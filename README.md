Gameplay

In PinkMan, the player controls the titular character using the arrow keys. The objective is to navigate through each level, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles and enemies, until reaching the end goal. The player must avoid touching enemies and obstacles, or else PinkMan will lose a life. If the player loses all their lives, the game is over.

The game features multiple levels, each with a different layout and set of obstacles and enemies. The difficulty increases with each level, making it harder for the player to reach the end goal. To help the player, there are power-ups available, such as speed boosts and invincibility, which can be collected by touching them.

Controls
Arrow Keys: Move PinkMan left, right, up, or down.
P: Pause the game.
Q: Quit the game.
